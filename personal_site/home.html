                    The following Map is a non interactive map. It is a temporary
                    stock image of a map as a place holder for the interactive map
                    that will be added in the beta version 1.0.1 which will release 
                    this fall. for now enjoy the rest of this excuciatingly high 
                    quality website.

                    Why come to this site over another? 
                    I think you'll notice that all other sites 
                    are trying to sell something like the home 
                    site of a local climbing gym for example, they're biased. 
                    Not me, if you want an unbiased view of where to climb  
                    you're in the right place! As you might have heard from 
                    the overwhelming support of the news and media, this 
                    site will is a good general hub for climbers accross the 
                    globe to come and have a good and easy time enjoying this wonderful 
                    sport. As you might also know this magnifacent website is in its
                    alpha stage and is therefore still in development (as indicated 
                    by the incomplete map above (and also the recent address given 
                    by the president of the United States of America about this 
                    site)). Unfortunately you'll just have to wait. In the meantime enjoy
                    this priview of the already world famous Dyno website with 
                    its links and pictures and map picture as well as a few of 
                    our first refiews of some climbs!
