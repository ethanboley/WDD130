      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I love climbing, I'm a rock climber, I enjoy finding fun and 
          challenging climbs. My company helps people like you find those 
          climbs. My company finds fun places to climb both indoor and outdoor,
          using your feedback. This results in an up to date, list of all the 
          best and most popular spots to have a good time. Whether you're an 
          outdoor or an indoor climber you may have experienced a point where 
          you didn't know where to go next. That's where I come in, my website 
          helps you never have a dull moment by seeing the best places to go 
          in real time and even all the tips and tricks of previous climbers. I 
          do this because I love it and I want new and veteran climbers to have 
          a good time wherever you go.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Climbing is a very versatile sport as it has many different 
          difficulties. For this reason the audience for this website is 
          basically everyone with at least a couple limbs, a brain and a desire
          to either start a new hobby or even just to have a one time adventure. 
          I for one have seen in my life a surprisingly diverse culture of 
          climbers and I Love it. I've seen a blind person climb a parapalegic 
          climb (better than me as it turns out), I've seen ten year old world 
          champs and ordinary folk like myself. So, really, there will be a
          very diverse group of people who may visit this site.

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Dyno Home page: Where to climb</h3>
      <p>
        Here on the main page there will be an on site (interactive) map of the
        surrounding neighborhood with good climbing locations pre-pinned and 
        ready to navigate to. Visitors need only to know where to find the site 
        and to know what the site offers. For this reason the links and buttons 
        clearly see from the main page and also some text surrounding them will 
        clearly define the page content and exactly what it offers. 
        Why come to this site over another? 
        All other sites are trying to sell something like the home site of a local 
        climbing gym for example, they're biased. Not me, I just like the sport 
        and enjoy spending time helping others feel the same about it. So 
        basically this site will be a good general hub for climbers all over 
        the place to come and have a good and easy time enjoying the sport. When 
        folk open up the site they will see something pretty simple, just a 
        navigation bar on the top of the page that will stay at the top of the 
        page and help the folks navigate the website more easily this will be 
        followed by a large stock looking image of a climbing gym right next to 
        a similarly stock-ish image of a mountain cliff side with folks 
        climbing on it likely both images will be of lead climbing. These 
        images will have buttons on them with descriptions below them which 
        will navigate them to different parts of that same page which will have 
        details about the respective button (outdoor or indoor). This home page 
        other than that will have links to the subpages in the header and links 
        to the media and contact information in the footer.
        Lower home page. These lower sections of the home page will have links 
        to and information about climbing gyms and their prices and other 
        things like that. Further down will be outdoor climbing locations and 
        their respective ratings and reviews.

      </ul>
      <h3>How to climb</h3>
      <p>
        A good part of my site will be dedicated to educating folks on climbing
        and how and what to look for in climbing as it pertains to their level 
        of experience and skill so they can know what to do, where to go, and 
        how to have the most fun while climbing. The other parts of the site 
        will be dedicated to making finding good locations easy and convenient. 
        Page 2 will be all about basically educating people about climbing and 
        terms and such. This page will, similar to the home page, have links to
        the subpages and the home page in the header and links to the home page 
        and this page will have a very simple footer with probably just 
        copyright info and contact info amid maybe a different colored 
        background. This page will also have things like fun facts and links to 
        videos of cool or inspiring or otherwise climbing related climbing 
        there may be a video from the tokyo olympics climbing events or likely 
        the world championship climbers, another about that one 10 year old 
        girl who was crushing records and there will also be videos that will 
        act as quick tutorials for those newer who wish to get into climbing, 
        other things like that.
