                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>
                    When you want to start climbing it is best to know that it really
                    isn't as simple as just rock clinbing. there are actually 2 diferent 
                    types of climbing as you can see from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhw1MgnBFUM">this</a> video. 
                    The types are: Lead Climbing, scailing a wall with a rope at your 
                    waist that you use to make it further up the wall; Traditional or 
                    Speed Climbing, climbing a wall with the rope already at the top 
                    and hooked to your harness; and, finally, Bouldering, more 
                    complicated but much shorter walls scaled without a rope or harness. 
                    It's important as you begin to learn about and engage in climbng 
                    that you know proper safety. Out door climbing is much more involved 
                    and typically requires a lot mor equipment and aid from others. all 
                    though that isn't to say that indoor climbing is not a sport in 
                    which you can't bring friends if you want. So grab a buddy and head 
                    to your local gym or a good cliff as indicated on our extremely helpful
                    map on the home page (really you should go check it out, its great).

                Honestly There isn't much to it; I still remember when I got into 
                climbing I was invited to an indoor gym to go bouldering with a 
                firend of mine. He'd been a climber for a while now and even 
                taken formal classes and things like that. So I decided to go and
                see what it was all about. I'm sure the same thing that happened 
                to me could happen to you as well, I loved my experience! It 
                wasn't just the thrill of completeing a difficult climb it was also 
                just fun to learn about the different types of holds and the 
                difficulty scailing and technique and all the little odds and ends. 
                So here are just a few of the basic things I learned in those days. 
                the things you hold onto are called holds or rocks and there are 
                three main kinds of them. First you have a "Jug" which is a hold 
                with a nice pocket for you to grip. Jugs are easilly the easiest 
                kinds of holds. Second you have a "Pinch" which is a rock with, 
                usually two main sides that you can, well, pinch between your 
                fingers. Last and infact least too, we have the "Crimp", nobody 
                likes the crimp; its a very small hold that you usually need to use 
                just the very tips of your fngers or the edge or even sides of your 
                shoes to grip. There are 2 major ways you can climb a wall or in 
                other words a problem, "Static" and "Kenetic". Static climbing is 
                very slow and methodical and controlled involving a lot of ballance, 
                endurance and flexability. Kenetic climbing is much more fast paced 
                with a lot of jumps and quick mvements. This form prioritizes power, 
                agility, coordination and accuracy above the careful progress of 
                static climbing. There are a bunch of different techniques and moves 
                you can pull off with each of these forms which I won't get too much 
                into but one move involved in kenetic climbing is where a climber 
                must physically leap from one rock to another which could be as far 
                as a full body length or more away. This move is called a "Dyno."
